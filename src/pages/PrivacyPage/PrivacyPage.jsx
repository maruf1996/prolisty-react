                        automatically and store it in log files like most other
                        websites. This information may include Internet protocol
                        (IP) addresses (the region or general location where
                        your computer or device is accessing the Internet),

                        and analysis about the usage, browsing patterns of our
                        users. They may independently record the type of device

                        Third Party Use of Information (including, but not
                        limited to Google Analytics Tracking, AdWords
                        Remarketing, Facebook Remarketing): Some of the services
                        and advertisements included on our website and in our
                        services are delivered or served by third-party
                        companies, which may collect information about your use
                        of our services. These companies may place or recognize
                        cookies, Web beacons, or other technology to track
                        certain non-personal information from our website users.
                        For example, in the course of serving certain
                        advertisements, an advertiser may place or recognize a
                        unique cookie on your browser in order to collect
                        certain information about your use of our services. For
                        another example, an advertiser or ad server may also be
                        able to collect your device’s unique identifier in the
                        course of serving an ad. In many cases, this information
                        could be used to show you ads on other websites based on
                        your interests. We may not control or have access to
                        these third parties’ use of cookies or other tracking
                        technologies or how they may be used. We use Google
                        Analytics to understand the way that visitors to our
                        website interact with it. We have enabled the following
                        Google Analytics advertising features:

                            collection of data via advertising cookies and
                            identifiers.

                        collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple
                        procedure in most browsers that allows a customer to
                        deny or accept the cookie feature; however, as
